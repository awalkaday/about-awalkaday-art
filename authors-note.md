# AUTHOR'S NOTE

_I work on this artistic project in my spare time, in public, independently, and at the pace of a_ [_turtle_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural\_depictions\_of\_turtles)_._&#x20;

_The first coding blocks of the project appeared online in_ [_November 2017_](https://github.com/daqhris/daqhris.github.io/commit/80a18e2a08c1413ea8b4a26d1a86129624b8809f)_. From the beginning, the creative process was intuitive, progressed non-linearly, and is time-stamped by a digital clock._

_This book is adapted from_ [_about.awalkaday.art_](https://about.awalkaday.art) _which has been a work-in-progress since_ [_May 2021_](https://github.com/awalkaday/about-awalkaday-art/commit/32eced8e914f46d9364a5d5fb6ec11c5bd7be7a4)_._&#x20;

_To view their combined history of changes, visit the open source code repository on_ [_GitHub.com_](https://github.com/awalkaday/about-awalkaday-art/tree/book)_._

_A visual chart showing additions and deletions to this public project, on a weekly basis over a long time window, is available at_ [_https://github.com/awalkaday/about-awalkaday-art/graphs/code-frequency_](https://github.com/awalkaday/about-awalkaday-art/graphs/code-frequency)
