# AUTHOR'S NOTE

_I created this artistic project in my spare time, in public, independently, and at the pace of a_ [_turtle_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural\_depictions\_of\_turtles)_. Countless public drafts and serene walks in the open air have shaped it into its present state, akin to a therapeutic exercise._

_The code building blocks of the project made a first appearance online in_ [_November 2017_](https://github.com/daqhris/daqhris.github.io/commit/80a18e2a08c1413ea8b4a26d1a86129624b8809f)_. From the beginning, the creative process was intuitive, non-linear, and time-stamped by a digital clock._

<p>Hello, I'm very glad that you have discovered A WALK≡A DAY !
</p>
<p><strong>INTRO</strong>
<br>Born out of simple boredom and burst of creativity, A WALK≡A DAY is a black and white visual arts project.
<br>Since then, every long walk ends with a collection of b&w photos snapped on-the-go by using a smartphone camera.
</p>
<p><strong>WHEN?</strong>
<br>The first image was published on Instagram (@all.day.walking) on July 19th, 2017.
<br>At least one picture is (or should be) posted on a daily basis.
<br>This art project's lifespan is 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong>
<br>A single motivating quote essentially inspired the creation of the project : "The Sun is up and running, everyday, for you."
<br>In a global trend of fast-paced urbanization, generations of kids are growing without a sense of curiosity of their surroundings and adventurous drive in the unfamiliar landscapes.
<br>Instagram, with 400 million daily active users, was selected as the most compelling internet platform to host such a street photography gallery that would target millenials and inspire them to creatively join a well-being movement. 
<br>Taking long walks and snapping lots of pictures along the way both became complimentary in my regular young adult life and I can't refrain from recommending this kind of endeavor to other fellow youngsters.
</p>
<p><strong>HOW?</strong>
<br>Images are shared in black and white format with a white wide frame.
<br>All pics are taken from an Android phone and later, edited in Snapseed.
<br>The hashtag #awalkaday is attached to every post and can be clicked on to view in bulk similar posts shared by the Instagram community.
</p>
<p><strong>WHERE?</strong>
<br>Photos are mostly taken at any time of the day from the streets and hidden alleys of Western Europe.
<br>I'm currently based in Belgium.
</p>
<p><strong>WHO?</strong>
<br>The person behind the #awalkaday art movement is Chris-Armel (@daqhris).
<br>He was born in Burundi and have previously traveled to Eastern Asia, Middle East and North Africa.
