# AUTHOR'S NOTE

_I created this artistic project in my spare time, in public, independently, and at the pace of a_ [_turtle_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural\_depictions\_of\_turtles)_. Countless public drafts and serene walks in the open air have shaped it into its present state, like a therapeutic exercise._

_The first coding blocks of the project appeared online in_ [_November 2017_](https://github.com/daqhris/daqhris.github.io/commit/80a18e2a08c1413ea8b4a26d1a86129624b8809f)_. From the beginning, the creative process was intuitive, non-linear, and time-stamped by a digital clock._

_This book features texts adapted from_ [_about.awalkaday.art_](https://about.awalkaday.art) _which has been a work-in-progress since_ [_May 2021_](https://github.com/awalkaday/about-awalkaday-art/commit/32eced8e914f46d9364a5d5fb6ec11c5bd7be7a4)_. The original code repository became the focus of my geeky attention and camera lenses soon after wrapping up my web coding classes at_ [_freeCodeCamp.org_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/daqhris)_._
