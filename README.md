### SUMMARY

This artist's book documents the development and growth of [awalkaday.art](https://awalkaday.art) from its conception in 2017 to its conclusion in 2024. The pages of this book are bound by the `git`-based digital footprints of the photo series, creating a narrative that's as much about the medium as the message.

A unique blend of digital art formsâ€”black-and-white photography, open-source code, social media posts, and blockchain tokensâ€”comes together with third-person narration to create a multifaceted story. Together, these elements illustrate and trace the history of a photo odyssey across a range of public spaces and computing platforms.

It is a companion piece to a collection of 263 photographs taken during regular walks in Belgium, Europe. An online book that concludes a long-term project by an exiled artist and an innovative approach to self-publishing digital art. Supported by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) as an open source project under a community plan.
