# Instagram

[Instagram](https://instagram.com/) enables users to showcase their creativity and connect through imagery and visual storytelling.&#x20;

The monochrome photographs were originally posted on Instagram by [@walk.day](https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/) (managed by [@iamdaqhris](https://www.instagram.com/iamdaqhris/)), on an almost daily basis, continuously for years, with shooting geolocation attached and platform timestamp appended.
