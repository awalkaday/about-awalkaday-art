# Ethereum

For the final leg of a trek on digital platforms, thanks to angelic backing provided by a cryptoasset wallet set up in [2017](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82#analytics), boostraped in [2021](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/daqhris), and set in motion in [2022](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82\&f=5), [daqhris](https://app.ens.domains/daqhris.eth) minted the 263 photographs, miraculously recovered after another chaotic winter, and preserved for the long run as non-fungible [ERC-721 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) on the Ethereum blockchain.



[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a decentralised blockchain platform that allows developers to create and deploy self-executing code in the form of smart contracts and applications. The artworks were wrapped in the _awalkaday.art Smart Contract_ and self-published on a public blockchain, where they can be verified, collected and exchanged. The smart contract address is `0xE31801C2E58b151C3deD2cB29dA56147b7f27eB1`.



The monochromatic sights were assembled, named and minted during a wintertime stay as a homeless person at the [_Palais des Droits_](https://archive.is/2JkUB), a former financial office building which had been converted into a squalid squat in Brussels. He was able to safeguard them on a state-of-the-art blockchain on [Valentine's Day](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b) in 2023, fortunately one day before a [planned eviction](https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/2023/02/09/schaerbeek-le-palais-des-droits-sera-vide-pour-le-15-fevrier-J4FJQRA6UBGYNA2I4KKPDM27LA/) from the infamous shelter.



After landing on a blockchain terrain in a batch series, each photo began to carry a name, in the form of a logbook. A string of words and numbers that begins with the artistic theme _awalkaday_, then ends with a computer-calculated [day of the year](https://www.inchcalculator.com/day-of-the-year/), linked by a hyphen to the year of when the photo was first dropped online without a parachute and crossed the radar of [cyberwarfare forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_cyber\_warfare\_forces) on a tourist visa (example: [_awalkaday 185-2022_](https://app.zerion.io/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82/nfts?collections=85657215)).
