# Web Gallery

After the project resumed, the photos started being uploaded to a purpose-built web gallery, [awalkaday.art](https://awalkaday.art/), which hosts a catalog of 263 photographs from the collection in a custom-designed, interactive and responsive gallery.&#x20;

It prioritises a smooth and random order of display for each visit, allowing for ease of navigation and discovery of photographs.&#x20;
