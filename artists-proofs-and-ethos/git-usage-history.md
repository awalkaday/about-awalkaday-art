# Git Usage History

The oldest GitHub-based commits written and signed by _daqhris_ date back to [February 2016](https://github.com/daqhris/hello-world/commits/master/?since=2016-02-22\&until=2016-06-15). They may be seen as the remnants of an extracurricular passion that infused an innovative spirit into a student's life in the East, spent crossing over the [Great Firewall of China](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown) and bypassing man-made virtual walls through private tunnels to wave _hello_ to the _world_.

Much earlier fragments of his public coding blocks were likely archived inside the GitHub-sponsored [Arctic Code Vault](https://arcticworldarchive.org/collection/arctic-code-vault/) in [February 2020](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/), among notable human-crafted software works, for over a thousand years. Looking way back, an initial foray into GitHub in May 2011, at the [age of nineteen](https://github.com/daqhris?tab=overview\&from=2011-05-01\&to=2011-06-01) in Bujumbura, Burundi (Africa), seems comparable to planting a seed of innovation in the fertile soil of a burgeoning digital platform. That seed has since blossomed into a time-stamped odyssey rooted in cyberspace and grounded on Belgian soil â€” _awalkaday.art._
