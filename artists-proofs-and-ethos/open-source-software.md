# Open Source Software

An open-source ethos which embodies principles such as transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development has been embraced with open arms.

To gain exposure to software-driven innovation, Chris-Armel (daqhris) has been an active contributor to the [Free and Open Source Software Developer Conference](https://fosdem.org/) in Brussels every year since 2020. The annual conference has enabled him to remain connected with the European software developer community, despite lacking the right to attend university or work professionally in the field.

As a volunteer, one of his memorable acts was standing on stage to introduce a talk about ['Open Source Software at NASA'](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/nasa/), presented by an [American astronomer](https://crawfordsm.github.io/about/), in front of a packed amphitheater in February 2023. In the summer of 2024, he has published an online book, [book.awalkaday.art](../), that shines a light on various aspects of his `git`-enabled artistic practice and is built with a technical documentation tool, [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).
