# Public Git Commits

[Git](https://github.com/git-guides#what-is-git) is a distributed version control software. Version control is a way to save changes over time without overwriting previous versions. [Git commits](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit#git-commit) represent snapshots of code changes in a version control system. Each commit captures modifications made by its developer(s). The commits of this public project are bound together by [cryptographic signatures](https://keybase.io/daqhris/graph) and organized in linear sequence within a lightweight file.

This digital art project treats the creative process as a series of iterative steps that rely on public `git` commits. In the same way that an artist traditionally refined creative works through proofs, the _awalkaday.art_ project has evolved incrementally, leaving behind a history rich trail of its development intact and public. It is not far from being seen as a novel concept that mimics what is defined as [evolution](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/the-history-of-life-looking-at-the-patterns/trees-not-ladders/) in the science of evolutionary biology.
