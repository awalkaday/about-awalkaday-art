# Public Git Commits

[Git](https://github.com/git-guides#what-is-git) is a distributed version control software. Version control is a way to save changes over time without overwriting previous versions.&#x20;

[Git commits](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit#git-commit) represent snapshots of code changes in a version control system. Each commit captures modifications made by its developer(s).&#x20;

The commits of this public project are bound together by [cryptographic signatures](https://keybase.io/daqhris/graph) and organised in linear sequence within a lightweight file.

This art project treats the creative process as a series of iterative steps that rely on public Git commits. Just as an artist refines his work through proofs, the _awalkaday.art_ project evolves incrementally, leaving behind a history rich trail of its development intact.&#x20;

It's not far from being seen as a novel concept that mimics what has been defined as [evolution](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/the-history-of-life-looking-at-the-patterns/trees-not-ladders/) in the science of evolutionary biology.
