# Project Inception Story

During the summer of 2017, Chris resided in a Red Cross camp for asylum seekers in Namur, Belgium. To combat prolonged boredom and physical inactivity, an idea sparked in his mind, urging him to combine his skills in black-and-white photography, visual design, and software coding in order to create an artistic project.



Using rudimentary photographic equipment and online public platforms, coupled with an open-source digital toolbox, he has visually documented a years-long journey that artfully depicts his time-bound walks and publicly logs his footprints around a land of refuge. He had initially landed in Belgium in the winter of 2016, seeking a safe haven away from the persecution by authorities of his homeland while abroad in China and their Chinese counterparts.



After six months of posting on Instagram and coding on GitHub, the artistic project was put on hold due to the loss of electronic devices, in the aftermath of a laptop crash and a smartphone theft in the camp. Three years later, in 2021, it was relaunched as a part-time artistic practice, even though his legal status and human life as an immigrant remained uncertain, hopeless, angst-inducing and precarious.



Contrary to modern conventions, _awalkaday.art_ is neither a state-sponsored artistic endeavor nor a brick-and-mortar art gallery. Since day one of the project, the artist has endured the human experience of lacking easy access to medical care, health insurance, humanitarian aid and banking services. He faced recurring unemployment, despite numerous skills, and burned only organic calories instead of emitting pollutants.
