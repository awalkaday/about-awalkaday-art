Chris started learning photography as a self-taught enthusiast during the early years of Instagram, around 2013. At the time, he was studying [computer science and engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_science\_and\_engineering) and working part-time in the film industry in Beijing, China.

His style combines traditional photographic techniques with digital editing and publishing tools. The photographs are monochrome with a 1:1 aspect ratio and capture the timeless charm of the Belgian landscape.
