The collection revolves around locations in [Belgium](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/52411) and explores a diverse range of scenes that include streets, landscapes, architecture, and nature.&#x20;

The monochromatic scenes document sightings of peculiar real-life environments and preserve the visual memories of a human wanderer, exiled away from homeland, on an intuitive quest propelled by regular walks.

These photographs were captured during walks through the streets and alleyways of [Flanders](https://www.visitflanders.com/en), [Wallonia](https://visitwallonia.be/), and [Brussels](https://www.visit.brussels/), regions within Belgium. The process of photographing spanned six years, with a gap of three years between time intervals: [2017](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/)-[2018](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd1VmXvHDSj/) and [2021](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPoPiLpAlG0/)-[2022](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkWOfX2DCPU/).

Traveling on foot became essential after the outbreak of a global pandemic in 2020. Therefore, the artist resumed his leisure activity and morphed it into a therapeutic mobile project.&#x20;

A minimalist technical plan was adopted to reduce the lingering fear of losing electronic tools (stolen, hacked, or malfunctioning) and to fuel a digital quest progressing at the rhythm of frequent and abrupt moves around a terrestrial territory seen as a land of adoption and refuge.
