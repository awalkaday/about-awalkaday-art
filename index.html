		<h1><b>About: WALK≡DAY</b></h1>
                <hr>
		      <p>Hi, I'm very glad that you have discovered <strong>WALK≡DAY Visual Arts Gallery</strong>.</p>
		      <h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b></h2>
              	<br>

		      <h4>WHAT</h4>
        <p><a href="https://awalkaday.art/" title="WALK≡DAY Visual Arts Gallery" target="_blank"><strong>WALK≡DAY</strong></a> is a digital art gallery that curates black-and-white visual artworks to inspire you to get up and go for a walk every day.</p>
        <p>The art gallery's <strong>mission statement</strong> is to motivate anyone (who comes across our artworks) to step outdoors, to enjoy a breath of fresh air, to marvel at the surrounding sights and to maintain a good physical condition by regularly taking a short or long walk.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/awalkaday" target="_blank"><strong>awalkaday.art NFT Collection</strong></a> contains uniquely elegant artworks made of nature, landscape and urban street photography. All photographic memories were recorded by <a href="https://opensea.io/daqhris" target="_blank"><strong>daqhris</strong></a> while going out for a daily walk.</p>
        <br>

		      <h4>WHEN</h4>
        <p>The first image was published on Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/"><strong>@walk.day</strong></a> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/"><mark>July 19, 2017</mark></a>.</p>
        <p>At least one image should be posted on a daily basis whenever possible. </p><br>

		      <h4>WHY</h4>
        <p>A single quote urged the start of this visual arts project : <mark>"The sun is up and running, everyday, for you"</mark>.</p>
        <p>In a global trend of fast-paced urbanization, generations of humans are growing without a <em>sense of curiosity</em> about their surroundings and an <em>adventurous drive</em> in unfamiliar landscapes. Few people even dare to do one of the least painful physical exercise: <em>walking</em>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day" title="Instagram account: @walk.day" target="_blank"><strong>Instagram</strong></a>, with millions of daily active users, was selected as the most compelling online social network for sharing our gallery's artworks that would definitely appeal to a global audience and ultimately inspire living a healthy lifestyle.</p> 
        <p><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/awalkaday" title="Purchase awalkaday.art NFTs on OpenSea" target="_blank"><strong>OpenSea</strong></a>, as the largest marketplace for trading non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, was chosen to be the art gallery's storefront and digital property exchange platform for selling our artworks.  
        </p>
        
        <p>Thanks to being an <strong>Ethereum blockchain-based digital art gallery</strong>, our artworks can be publicly verified, collected and exchanged. Everyone is encouraged to <strong>remix, reuse, repurpose the NFTs</strong> on any Web3 platform.</p><br>

		      <h4>HOW</h4>
        <p>WALK≡DAY's artworks are first of all posted on Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/"><mark>@walk.day</mark></a> in a black-and-white format with a wide white frame, then published at our online art gallery <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="WALK≡DAY Visual Arts Gallery"><mark>https://awalkaday.art</mark></a> and afterwards, sold as NFTs in our OpenSea store.</p>
        <p>The pictures are taken from an <a href="https://www.android.com/one/" title="Secure, up-to-date and easy to use Android devices" target="_blank"><strong>Android</strong></a> smartphone camera and later, enhanced by using photo-editing applications.</p>
        <p>The hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/awalkaday/"><strong>#awalkaday</strong></a> is attached to every post on social media and can be used to discover similar posts shared by the community on Instagram.</p>
        <p>All collectible items are minted as <strong>non-fungible tokens</strong> (ERC-1155) on the Ethereum blockchain. Revenue from the sale of the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/awalkaday" target="_blank" title="awalkaday.art - Collection | OpenSea"><mark>awalkaday.art NFT Collection</mark></a> flows directly into the <a href="https://daqhris.com/crypto-growth-fund/" title="daqhris.eth Crypto Growth Fund" target="_blank"><strong>daqhris.eth Crypto Growth Fund</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>Our code repository is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/awalkaday/awalkaday-art" title="GitHub public code repository" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> where any changes can be monitored or audited. The repository contains all historical commits starting from day one of the project.</p><br>

		      <h4>WHERE</h4>
        <p>Photos are captured at any time of the day from the streets and alleys of <mark>Western Europe</mark> while strolling around.</p>
        <p>The photographer is currently based in <strong>Belgium</strong>.</p><br>

		      <h4>WHO</h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/awalkaday/">#awalkaday</a> art project is run by <a href="https://daqhris.com/" target="_blank" title="Home | Chris A. Iradukunda"><mark>Chris-Armel</mark></a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamdaqhris" target="_blank" title="Instagram account of art project creator"><strong>@iamdaqhris</strong></a>).</p>
        <p>Born in Burundi (East Africa), he has previously lived in East Asia and North Africa.</p>
        <p>While living in an asylum seeker camp in Namur (Belgium) during the summer of 2017, Chris found a way to battle extended boredom and physical inactivity by having a burst of creativity geared towards putting into practice his photography and coding skills. This is how the idea of a digital art gallery named WALK≡DAY was born. Sadly, after a year, the loss of his electronic devices led to a temporary pause of artworks creation. Then, starting from 2020, this art project was relaunched with great vigor.</p>
