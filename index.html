		<h1><b>About: awalkaday.art</b></h1>
                <hr>
		      <p>Welcome to <strong>awalkaday.art</strong>, a photography collection based on the Ethereum blockchain, created by Chris-Armel (daqhris) and on-display at his online gallery, WALK≡DAY.</p>
            <p>This collection showcases the natural beauty and diversity of different regions and cultures in Belgium through stunning and captivating photographs.</p>
            <p>Each artwork is published as a unique digital asset on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that it is authentic, verifiable, and can be collected by anyone with a digital wallet.</p><br>

		      <h3>Mission and Purpose</h3>

        <p>The art collection's mission is to motivate everyone to step outdoors, to enjoy a breath of fresh air, to marvel at the surrounding sights and to maintain a good physical condition by regularly taking a short or long walk.</p>

        <p>In a global trend of fast-paced urbanization, generations of humans are growing without a sense of curiosity about their surroundings and an adventurous drive in unfamiliar landscapes. Few people even dare to do one of the least painful physical exercise: walking.</p>

        <p>Launched in 2021, awalkaday.art is the digital manifestation of Chris-Armel's passion for photography and his desire to share his creative talent with the world. The website and the smart contract share the same brand name and visual identity, making it easy for anyone to find and access the digital collection.</p><br>

		      <h3>Historical Milestones</h3>
          
                <p>The digital art collection has come a long way since its inception. Over the years, the artist has:<p>
                <ul>
                  <li>captured and shared hundreds of breathtaking images of different regions in Belgium.</li>
    <li>built a following on Instagram and Twitter, with hundreds of fans and followers from all over the world.</li>
    <li>established an online gallery that serves as a platform for showcasing the collections's works of art.</li></ul>               

        <p>The first image was published on Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/" target="_blank">July 19, 2017</a>. The web domain <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> was registered on <a href="https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art" target="_blank">May 5, 2021</a>. Some artworks were exhibited online by the <a href="https://monolith.gallery/archives" target="_blank">MONOLITH Gallery</a>, in the Sellen Hall, on <a href="https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG" target="_blank">July 8, 2022</a>.</p>
                
        <p>The on-chain presence of the collection started with the establishment of a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/" target="_blank">smart contract</a>, similarly named, on <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cce44b92db9e6eb887fcbe90d59f5951e9928dea4540afbfe9fd3c2e9662f1f" target="_blank">August 07, 2022</a>. Afterwards, the Internet domain name <a href="https://app.ens.domains/name/awalkaday.art/details" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> was set up as an Ethereum name on <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353f1900e073e6d97f8230021c3fce153b4b930269e5c8bd4f47c9c3950b9337" target="_blank">September 17, 2022</a>. The first batch of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank">WALK tokens</a> were minted on-chain, on <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b" target="_blank">February 14, 2023</a>, by <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" title="Artist's Ethereum wallet address" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a>.</p><br>
                
		      <h3>Artwork Creation</h3>
                
        <p>A thoughtful quote inspires the creation of every piece in this visual arts project: <strong>"The sun is up and running, everyday, for you"</strong>.</p>
                
        <p>The pictures are taken, enhanced and edited by using software applications which are installed on a <a href="https://www.android.com/one/" title="Secure, up-to-date and easy-to-use Android devices" target="_blank">smartphone device</strong></a>.</p>
        
        <p>The collection proudly gravitates around Belgian locations and features a wide range of subjects, including landscapes, architecture, and wildlife. Photos are captured at any time of the day, during hikes or strolls, throughout the streets and alleys of Belgium, the heart of Europe.</p><br>

        <h3>Content Distribution</h3>

        <p>The collection's artworks are often shared on <strong>Twitter</strong>, where the artist, tweeting via the account <a href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a>, connects with a wide audience and builds relationships with fellow art creators and collectors.</p>
                
        <p>Images are first of all posted on <strong>Instagram</strong> (by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a>) in a black-and-white format with a wide white frame, then added to the web gallery (<a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="WALK≡DAY Visual Arts Gallery" target="_blank">https://awalkaday.art</a>) and afterwards, minted as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/" title="ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard" target="_blank">ERC-721 NFTs</a> on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

        <p>Thanks to being a photo collection published on the <strong>Ethereum</strong> blockchain, the digital artworks can be publicly verified, collected and exchanged. Everyone is encouraged to remix, reuse, repurpose the NFTs on any Web3 platform. The smart contract address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank"><code>0xE31801C2E58b151C3deD2cB29dA56147b7f27eB1</code></a>.</p>
                
        <p>The code that runs the web gallery is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/awalkaday/awalkaday-art" title="GitHub public code repository" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> where any changes can be monitored and audited. This public repository contains all historical commits starting from day one of the project.</p><br>

		<h3>Creator Profile</h3>
                
        <p><a href="https://daqhris.com" target="_blank">Chris-Armel</a> is the founder, photographer and developer of awalkaday.art. He is a versatile visual arts creator, living in Belgium as an undocumented refugee of Burundian nationality.</p> 
            
        <p>Despite the challenges he faces, Chris-Armel continues to pursue his passion for art and photography with relentless dedication and commitment. His work is a testament to his resilience and creativity, inspiring others to follow in his footsteps and pursue their dreams, no matter what obstacles they may face.</p>
                  
        <p>Chris began teaching himself photography during the early years of Instagram (circa 2013), while living in Beijing (China) as undergraduate student. His unique style combines traditional photography techniques with digital editing tools, resulting in stunning and captivating images that showcase the natural beauty of Belgium.</p>
                  
        <p>Through his art, Chris-Armel aims to raise awareness about appreciating our planet and living a healthy lifestyle. He is a strong advocate for individual freedoms and social justice, using his photography as a means to document his journey to a new home as a person who had been cruelly persecuted by the authorities of his native country and their Chinese counterparts.</p>
                
        <p>Born in Burundi (East Africa), he has previously lived in East Asia and North Africa. During the summer of 2017, when he was living in a Red Cross asylum seeker camp in Namur (Belgium), Chris found a way to battle extended boredom and physical inactivity by having a burst of creativity geared towards blending his skills in monochrome photography, visual design and software coding.</p>
                
        <p>However, the project had to be temporarily paused, after a year of regular social media posts, due to the loss of electronic devices. Fast forward three years to 2021, WALK≡DAY was relaunched with renewed energy and became a top-priority occupation.
