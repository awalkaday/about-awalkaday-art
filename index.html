      <h3>Introduction to the Photo Series</h3>
      <p>Welcome to <a href="https://awalkaday.art" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection"
          target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a>, a collection of 263 photographs created by Chris-Armel (<a href="https://daqhris.com/" target="_blank">daqhris</a>) and published on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> blockchain since February 2023. <br />

          This ongoing body of work captures the enchanting beauty seen in diverse landscapes of various Belgian regions through a captivating series of monochrome photographs. <br />

          Each photograph is assigned a unique identification token on the blockchain, guaranteeing its authenticity, verifiability, and accessibility to collectors with a digital wallet.</p>

      <p>Through the lens of Chris-Armel, awalkaday.art  is more than just a digital gallery; it is a testament to his passion for photography and a vessel for sharing his creative skills across oceans and borders.  
        The web gallery and Ethereum smart contract are seamlessly aligned in branding and visual identity, ensuring effortless navigation for all who wish to discover and engage with this travelogue.</p>

      <h3>Chronicles of Creation: Navigating the Milestones</h3>

      <p>Let's dive into the key moments that have shaped his artistic journey — an odyssey navigated in solitude that has given birth to awalkaday.art. 
        Each milestone not only marks a significant achievement, but also adds another chapter to the evolving story of this distinctive endeavor.  
        Join us as we explore the turning points, triumphs and transformative experiences that have shaped the nature of awalkaday.art.</p>

      <p>The photo collection has evolved since its inception. Over the years, the artist has:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>captured and shared a series of monochrome photographs, depicting the beauty of different places in Belgium.</li>
        <li>cultivated a dedicated following on social media platforms, with hundreds of friends, followers and fans from all over the world.</li>
        <li>built an open source online gallery to provide a digital venue to showcase these photographs.</li>
        <li>created an immersive exhibition space in a 3D virtual environment that is open to the public at all times.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The artistic journey began in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/" target="_blank">July 2017</a>, when the first photograph was posted on Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/"
          target="_blank">@walk.day</a>.<br>

          Years later, in <a
          href="https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art" target="_blank">May 2021</a>, the Internet domain <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> was officially registered.<br>

        An X (formerly Twitter) account, <a href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a>, was launched in November 2021 to share updates with a live and international audience. <br> 

        A meaningful milestone was reached when selected photographs graced the virtual walls of the <a href="https://monolith.gallery/archives"
          target="_blank">MONOLITH Gallery</a> at Sellen Hall in <a
          href="https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG" target="_blank">July 2022</a>.</p>

      <p>The blockchain publication of the collection was achieved with the creation of an eponymous <a
          href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/" target="_blank">smart contract</a> in <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cce44b92db9e6eb887fcbe90d59f5951e9928dea4540afbfe9fd3c2e9662f1f"
          target="_blank">August 2022</a>.<br>

          This was followed by the registration of <a
          href="https://app.ens.domains/name/awalkaday.art/details" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> as an Ethereum domain in 
          <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353f1900e073e6d97f8230021c3fce153b4b930269e5c8bd4f47c9c3950b9337" target="_blank">September 2022</a>.<br>

          About half a year later, the first batch of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1"
          target="_blank">WALK tokens</a> were minted on Ethereum by <a
          href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82"
          title="Artist's Ethereum wallet address" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a> in <a
          href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b"
          target="_blank">February 2023</a>, marking a significant moment in the on-chain history of awalkaday.art.
      </p>

      <h3>Artwork Creation</h3>

      <p>The collection focuses on Belgian locations and features a variety of subjects including landscapes,
        architecture, and wildlife. The photographs are taken at any time of day, during walks or strolls through the
        streets and alleys of Belgium.</p>

      <p>Photos are captured and edited using software applications installed on a <a
          href="https://www.android.com/one/" title="Secure, up-to-date and easy-to-use Android devices"
          target="_blank">smartphone</strong></a>.

        The low-cost smartphone, developed by a Finnish company, is equipped with two rear cameras, including a
        13-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, which can produce decent details in well-lit
        conditions.

        The camera has basic features that balance highlights and shadows in photos, and help with scene recognition and
        optimization, but these are limited by mediocre sensors.</p>

      <h3>Content Distribution</h3>

      <p>The collection's photographs are shared on <strong>Twitter</strong> where the artist, tweeting through <a
          href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a>, connects with a diverse audience
        and builds relationships with fellow artists and collectors.</p>

      <p>The 'awalkaday' photographs were firstly posted on <strong>Instagram</strong> (by <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a>), then uploaded to the web gallery
        (<a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection"
          target="_blank">https://awalkaday.art</a>), and finally minted as <a
          href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"
          title="ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard" target="_blank">ERC-721 non-fungible tokens</a> on the Ethereum
        blockchain.</p>

      <p>Since it is a collection published on the <strong>Ethereum blockchain</strong>, digital artworks can be
        publicly verified, collected, and exchanged.<br>
        The smart contract address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1"
          target="_blank"><code>0xE31801C2E58b151C3deD2cB29dA56147b7f27eB1</code></a>.</p>

      <p>The web gallery's source code is hosted on <strong>GitHub</strong>, where all changes can be tracked and
        audited.<br>
        The public code repository contains all historical commits starting from day one of the project: <a

      <h3>Artist Profile</h3>

      <p><a href="https://daqhris.com" target="_blank">Chris-Armel</a> is the photographer and software developer of the
        awalkaday.art photography collection. He is a Burundi-born visual artist who currently lives in Belgium.</p>

      <p>It was in the very early days of Instagram (circa 2013) that Chris began to learn photography as a self-taught
        artist. At the time, he was a computer science student in Beijing, China. His unique style combines both
        traditional photography techniques and digital editing tools. The result is captivating photographs that
        highlight the natural charm of the Belgian landscape.</p>

      <p>Through digital photography, Chris-Armel aims to raise awareness about living a healthy and active lifestyle.
        In addition, he creatively uses his photographic skills to document a journey of living in a country of refuge
        after being persecuted by the authorities of his native country and their Chinese counterparts.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2017, while living in a Red Cross camp for asylum seekers in Namur, Belgium, Chris found a way
        to combat prolonged boredom and physical inactivity through a burst of creativity aimed at combining his skills
        in monochrome photography, visual design, and software coding.</p>

      <p>However, after one year of regular social media posts, the project was paused due to the loss of electronic
        equipment. Three years afterward, in the year 2021, the 'awalkaday' project was relaunched and became a
        part-time creative endeavor. To learn more, you may view his full bio online at <a
