		<h1><b>About: awalkaday.art</b></h1>
                <hr>
		      <p>Welcome to awalkaday.art, a collection of photographs created by Chris-Armel (daqhris) and published entirely on the Ethereum blockchain.  
            This collection showcases the natural wonders and diverse landscapes of several Belgian regions through a series of monochrome photographs. 
            Each piece of art is published as a unique digital asset on the blockchain, ensuring that they are authentic, verifiable, and available for collection by anyone with a digital wallet.</p>

		      <h3>Mission and Purpose</h3>

        <p>The mission of the photo collection is to motivate everyone to get outdoors, enjoy the fresh air, marvel at the surrounding sights, and maintain good physical condition through regular short or long walks.</p>

        <p>In a global trend of rapid urbanization, generations of people are growing up uninspired by their surroundings and unwilling to explore unfamiliar landscapes. Few people even dare to do one of the least painful physical exercises: walking.</p>

        <p>awalkaday.art is the digital manifestation of Chris-Armel's passion for photography and his desire to share his creative talent with the world. The web gallery and blockchain smart contract share the same branding and visual identity, making it easy for anyone to find and access the digital collection.</p>

		      <h3>Historical Milestones</h3>
          
                <p>The awalkaday.art collection has come a long way since its inception. Over the years, the artist has:<p>
          <ul>
    <li>captured and shared hundreds of stunning images of different regions in Belgium.</li>
    <li>gained a following on Instagram and Twitter with hundreds of fans and followers worldwide.</li>
    <li>created an open source online gallery to showcase his photographs.</li>
          </ul>               

        <p>The first image was posted on Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/" target="_blank">July 19, 2017</a>. The web domain <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> was registered on <a href="https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art" target="_blank">May 5, 2021</a>. Some of the photographs were exhibited online in the <a href="https://monolith.gallery/archives" target="_blank">MONOLITH Gallery</a> in Sellen Hall on <a href="https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG" target="_blank">July 8, 2022</a>.</p>
                
        <p>The collection's on-chain presence began with the creation of a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/" target="_blank">smart contract</a> of the same name on <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cce44b92db9e6eb887fcbe90d59f5951e9928dea4540afbfe9fd3c2e9662f1f" target="_blank">August 07, 2022</a>. 
          This was followed by the registration of the web domain name <a href="https://app.ens.domains/name/awalkaday.art/details" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> as an Ethereum name on <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353f1900e073e6d97f8230021c3fce153b4b930269e5c8bd4f47c9c3950b9337" target="_blank">September 17, 2022</a>. 
          The first batch of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank">WALK tokens</a> was minted on-chain by <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" title="Artist's Ethereum wallet address" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a> on <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b" target="_blank">February 14, 2023</a>.
          </p>
                
		      <h3>Artwork Creation</h3>
                
        <p>A thoughtful quote inspires the creation of each piece in this visual art project: <strong>"The sun is up and running, every day, for you."</strong></p>
                
        <p>Photos are taken and edited using software applications on a <a href="https://www.android.com/one/" title="Secure, up-to-date and easy-to-use Android devices" target="_blank">smartphone</strong></a>.</p>
        
        <p>The collection proudly focuses on Belgian locations and features a variety of subjects including landscapes, architecture and wildlife. The photographs are taken at any time of day, during walks or strolls through the streets and alleys of Belgium.</p>

        <h3>Content Distribution</h3>

        <p>The collection's photographs are shared on <strong>Twitter</strong>, where the artist, who tweets through the account <a href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a>, connects with a diverse audience and builds relationships with fellow artists and collectors.</p>
                
        <p>The images were all first posted on <strong>Instagram</strong> (by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a>), then uploaded to the web gallery (<a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection" target="_blank">https://awalkaday.art</a>), and finally minted as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/" title="ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard" target="_blank">ERC-721 non-fungible tokens</a> on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

        <p>Since it is a collection of photographs published on the Ethereum blockchain, the digital artworks can be publicly verified, collected, and exchanged. The smart contract address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank"><code>0xE31801C2E58b151C3deD2cB29dA56147b7f27eB1</code></a>.</p>

		<h3>Creator Profile</h3>
                
        <p><a href="https://daqhris.com" target="_blank">Chris-Armel</a> is the creator, photographer, and software developer of the awalkaday.art photography collection. He is a Burundian-born visual artist living in Belgium.</p> 
                  
        <p>In the early days of Instagram (circa 2013), Chris started teaching himself photography. At the time, he was a college student living in Beijing, China. His unique style combines traditional photographic techniques with digital editing tools. The result is stunning and captivating photographs that highlight the natural charm of the Belgian landscape.</p>
                  
        <p>Through art, Chris-Armel aims to raise awareness about living a healthy and active lifestyle. In addition, he creatively uses his photographic skills to document a journey of living in a country of refuge after being persecuted by the authorities of his native country and their Chinese counterparts.</p>
                
        <p>In the summer of 2017, while living in a Red Cross camp for asylum seekers in Namur, Belgium, Chris found a way to combat prolonged boredom and physical inactivity through a burst of creativity aimed at combining his skills in monochrome photography, visual design, and software coding.</p>
                
        <p>However, after a year of regular social media posts, the project was paused due to the loss of electronic equipment. Three years later, in 2021, awalkaday.art was relaunched with renewed energy and became a top priority.
