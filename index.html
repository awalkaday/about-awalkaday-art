      <h3>1. Introduction to the Photo Series</h3>
      <p>Welcome to <a href="https://awalkaday.art" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection"
          target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a>, a collection of 263 photographs created by Chris-Armel (daqhris) and published on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> blockchain since February 2023. 

          This digital body of work captures the enchanting beauty seen in diverse landscapes of various Belgian regions through a captivating series of monochrome photographs. 

          Each photograph is assigned a unique identification token on the blockchain, guaranteeing its authenticity, verifiability, and accessibility to collectors with a digital wallet.</p>

      <h3>2. Beyond Pixels: A Stroll into Nature's Canvas</h3>

      <p>Embark on a visual journey with awalkaday.art, where the mission transcends pixels to ignite a passion for the great outdoors. 
        More than just a visual spectacle, this collection is a call to embrace the rejuvenating power of nature, urging everyone to go outside, 
        enjoy the fresh air, be captivated by the surroundings and cultivate well-being through the simplicity of regular walks, whether short or long.</p>

      <p>In an age of rapid urbanisation, many people feel disconnected from their local environment and lack the inspiration to explore unfamiliar landscapes. 
        The art of walking, one of the least tiring yet most rewarding physical activities, remains overlooked by most.</p>

      <p>Through the lens of Chris-Armel, awalkaday.art  is more than just a digital gallery. It is a testament to his passion for photography and a vessel for sharing his creative skills across borders and oceans.  
        The web gallery and smart contract are seamlessly aligned to ensure effortless navigation for all who wish to discover and engage with this travelogue.</p>

      <h3>3. Chronicles of Creation: Navigating the Milestones</h3>

      <p>Let's dive into key moments that have shaped his artistic journey — an odyssey navigated in solitude on the creative path leading to awalkaday.art. 
        Each milestone not only marks a significant achievement, but also adds another chapter to an evolving story.  
        Join us as we explore the turning points, triumphs and transformative experiences that have shaped the nature of this photography series.</p>

      <h4>3.1. Innovative and Ongoing Pathways</h4>
      <p>The photo collection has evolved since its inception. Over the years, the artist has:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>captured 263 monochrome photographs featuring various locations in Belgium.</li>
        <li>attracted a dedicated following on social media platforms, with acquaintances, supporters, and enthusiasts.</li>
        <li>built an online photo gallery as a digital venue to host and showcase his artistic work.</li>
        <li>published a smart contract containing his photo catalog on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
        <li>created a virtual exhibition hall in a three-dimensional environment to simulate a lifelike exposition of 24 photographs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3.2. Internet Footprints</h4>

      <p>This artistic journey began in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/" target="_blank">July 2017</a>, when the first photograph was posted on Instagram.

          Years later, in <a
          href="https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art" target="_blank">May 2021</a>, the Internet domain awalkaday.art was officially registered.

          In November 2021, a Twitter account was created to share news with a worldwide audience in real-time. </p> 

        <p>A meaningful milestone was reached when selected photographs graced the virtual walls of the <a href="https://monolith.gallery/archives"
          target="_blank">MONOLITH Gallery</a> at Sellen Hall in <a
          href="https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG" target="_blank">July 2022</a>.
        
          Since <a href="https://x.com/awalkadayart/status/1703776310252736941?s=20" target="_blank">September 2023</a>, the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank">smart contract</a> and the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" target="_blank">contract deployer</a> are labeled by <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank">Etherscan</a>.  
          A congratulatory message citing the virtual exhibition hall was posted by <a href="https://art.art/" title=".ART domains - digital identity for your creative personality" target="_blank">.ART domains</a> on two social media platforms in <a href="https://x.com/Art_Domains/status/1755917791658418315?s=20" target="_blank">February 2024</a>.</p>

      <h4>3.3. Blockchain Records</h4>

      <p>The blockchain publication of the collection was achieved with the creation of an eponymous <a
          href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/" target="_blank">smart contract</a> in <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cce44b92db9e6eb887fcbe90d59f5951e9928dea4540afbfe9fd3c2e9662f1f" target="_blank">August 2022</a>.

          This was followed by the registration of <a
          href="https://app.ens.domains/awalkaday.art" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> as an Ethereum domain in 
          <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353f1900e073e6d97f8230021c3fce153b4b930269e5c8bd4f47c9c3950b9337" target="_blank">September 2022</a>.

          About half a year later, the first batch of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1"
          target="_blank">WALK tokens</a> were minted on Ethereum by <a
          href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" title="Artist's Ethereum wallet address" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a> in <a
          href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b" target="_blank">February 2023</a>, marking a significant moment in the on-chain history of awalkaday.art.
      </p>

      <p>In the virtual realm of digital art platforms, the artist has created a profile on behalf of his work and listed artworks on <a href="https://nft.coinbase.com/collection/awalkaday-art" target="_blank">Coinbase NFT</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/collection/awalkaday-art" target="_blank">Foundation</a>, <a href="https://rc.xyz/daqhris/collections/awalkaday.art" target="_blank">Rightclick</a>, <a href="https://thehug.xyz/artists/daqhris/portfolio/gallery/86a4f0a8-5609-4885-a9e2-ca0b625082e9" target="_blank">The Hug</a> and <a href="https://zora.co/collect/eth:0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1">Zora</a> in the second half of 2023. 
        As an independent creative coder, he will participate in <a href="https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels" target="_blank">ETHGlobal Brussels</a>, a software tournament focused on Ethereum, in July 2024.</p>

      <h3>4. Mobile Studio and Tools</h3>

      <h4>4.1. On-the-go Photography</h4>

      <p>The collection centers around locations in Belgium and explores a diverse range of scenes that include streets, landscapes, architecture, and nature. 

         The monochromatic scenes document sightings and preserve the memories of a human wanderer, exiled away from homeland, on an intuitive quest propelled by regular walks. 

         These photographs were captured during walks through the streets and alleyways of Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels, regions within Belgium. The process of photographing spanned six years, with a gap of three years between time intervals: 2017-2018 and 2021-2022.</p>

      <p>Traveling on foot became essential after the outbreak of a global pandemic in 2020. The artist resumed his recreational activity and turned it into a therapeutic mobile project. 
        A minimalist technical plan was adopted to reduce the lingering fear of electronic tool loss or malfunction in order to enhance a digital quest progressing at the rhytm of frequent and abrupt moves around a terrestrial territory seen as both an adoptive country and a land of refuge.</p>

      <h4>4.2. Camera and Editing</h4>

  <p>At the begining of this travelogue on Western soil, between 2017 and 2018, a Xiaomi smartphone, purchased in Beijing around 2015, was the tool in-use for recording and editing still images.

In early 2021, a smartphone operating under <a
          href="https://www.android.com/one/" title="Android One: Secure, up-to-date and easy-to-use Android devices"
          target="_blank">Android One</a> software system was purchased to meet the need for a dedicated mobile camera which regularly receives secure updates from its software developer, Google. </p>

      <p>Most of the photographs were edited using Android software applications, such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed" title="Snapseed" target="_blank">Snapseed</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vector123.whiteborder" title="White Border: Square Fit Photo" target="_blank">White Border</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif" title="Scrambled Exif" target="_blank">Scrambled Exif</a>, installed on a Nokia smartphone.
          The low-cost phone was equipped with two rear cameras, including a 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, which can produce decent detail in well-lit conditions. 
          Overall, the camera had basic features to balance highlights and shadows in photographs and assist with scene recognition and optimization, but these were limited by the mediocre sensors.</p> 

      <h4>4.3. Gaming Laptop</h4>

      <p>A laptop computer, branded as Hasee God of War and acquired on the Asian continent, was very useful for coding sessions while building the online gallery on top of digital foundations.  
        This device was one of the few items that he was able to keep after being arbitrarily detained by Chinese authorities in June 2016.</p>
 
       <p>Unfortunately, the gaming computer mysteriously crashed during a malware analysis in the winter of 2022. 
        The nearly decade-old computing device, still alive and undiagnosed in his care, eventually regained basic functionality under Linux software.</p>


      <h3>5. Artistic Workflow on Computer Networks</h3>

      <h4>5.1. X (Twitter)</h4>

      <p><a href="https://x.com" target="_blank">X</a> facilitates real-time communication and micro-blogging, allowing users to share short-form media works and engage in public conversations. 
       Recent news about the collection are shared on X, where the artist posting via <a
          href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a> connects with a diverse audience and builds relationships with fellow artists and collectors.</p>

      <h4>5.2. Instagram</h4>

      <p><a href="https://instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> emphasizes visual storytelling through photos and videos, enabling users to showcase their creativity and connect through imagery. 
        The monochrome photographs were originally posted on Instagram by <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a> (managed by <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/iamdaqhris/" target="_blank">@iamdaqhris</a>), on an almost daily basis, continuously for years, with the geolocation and timestamp of the shot attached.</p> 
        
      <h4>5.3. Web Gallery</h4>  
      <p>The photos were then uploaded to a purpose-built web gallery, <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection"
          target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a>, which hosts a catalog of 263 photographs from the collection in a custom-designed, interactive and immersive venue. It prioritises a smooth and random display of photographs, allowing for easy navigation and discovery of photographs. 
          A 3D exhibition space has also been set up to welcome all virtual visitors at <a href="https://oncyber.io/awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="3D Exhibition Hall for awalkaday.art Photo Collection"
          target="_blank">oncyber.io/awalkaday.art</a>.</p>
          
      <h4>5.4. Ethereum</h4>

      <p>At last, <a href="https://app.ens.domains/daqhris.eth" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a> (<a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" target="_blank">0xb5ee030c71e76C3E03B2A8d425dBb9B395037C82</a>) minted the visual artworks as non-fungible <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/" title="ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard" target="_blank">ERC-721 tokens</a> on the Ethereum blockchain. <br>
        <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> is a decentralised blockchain platform that allows developers to create and deploy self-executing code in the form of smart contracts and applications. 
        The artworks were wrapped in the awalkaday.art smart contract and self-published on a public blockchain, where they can be verified, collected and exchanged.
        The smart contract address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank"><code>0xE31801C2E58b151C3deD2cB29dA56147b7f27eB1</code></a>.</p>

      <h3>6. Artist's Proofs: Git Commits & Open-Source</h3>

      <h4>6.1. Public Git Commits</h4>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is renowned for its collaborative environment for software development, offering version control and project management tools for programmers.<br> 

        The underlying source code for the awalkaday.art Photo Collection is hosted on GitHub, where all changes can be tracked and audited. 
        The public code repositories, available in <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> format, contain all commits and code changes from day one of the project at <a href="https://github.com/awalkaday" title="GitHub public code repository" target="_blank">github.com/awalkaday</a>.</p>

        <p>Git commits represent snapshots of code changes in a version control system. Each commit captures modifications made by developers. The commits are bound together by a cryptographic signature and organized in a linear sequence inside a lightweight digital file.<br> 

The awalkaday.art project involves treating the creative process like a series of iterative steps (akin to Git commits). Just as an artist refines their work through proofs, the project may evolve incrementally, leaving a trace of its development.
</p>

      <h4>6.2. Open-Source Ethos</h4>

      <p>An open-source ethos which embodies principles such as transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development has been embraced with open arms. 
         To gain exposure to software-driven innovation, Chris-Armel (daqhris) has been an active contributor to the <a href="https://fosdem.org" title="FOSDEM Conference" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software Developer Conference</a> in Brussels every year since 2020. 
        It enables him to remain connected with the European software developer community, despite lacking the right to attend university or work professionally in the field.</p>

      <p>As a volunteer, one of his memorable acts was standing on stage to introduce a talk about <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/nasa/" title="NASA and Open Source Software, by Steve Crawford"
        target="_blank">'Open Source Software at NASA'</a>, presented by an <a href="https://crawfordsm.github.io/about/" target="_blank">American astronomer</a>, in front of a packed amphitheater in February 2023. 
        In the coming days, he plans to write an online book that will shine a light on various aspects of his Git-enabled artistic practice and will be powered by a technical documentation tool, <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/" title="Public Documentation Software - GitBook.com" target="_blank">GitBook</a>.</p>

      <h3>7. Artist Profile</h3>

       <h4>7. 1. Human Identity</h4>

      <p><a href="https://daqhris.com" target="_blank">Chris-Armel (daqhris)</a> is the photographer and software developer behind the digital life of the awalkaday.art Photography Collection. The visual artist was born in Burundi and currently lives in Belgium.</p>

        <h4>7. 2. Training Ground</h4>

      <p>Chris began learning photography as a self-taught enthusiast during the early days of Instagram, around 2013. 
        At that time, he was studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science_and_engineering">computer science and engineering</a> while also working part-time in the film industry in Beijing, China. 
        His style combines traditional photography techniques with digital editing tools. 
        The photographs are monochrome and capture the timeless charm of the Belgian landscape. 
        Using his photographic skills, he documented a journey of living in a country of refuge after being persecuted by the authorities of his homeland while abroad and their Chinese counterparts.</p>

        <h4>7. 3. Inception Story</h4>

      <p>During the summer of 2017, Chris resided in a Red Cross camp for asylum seekers in Namur, Belgium. To combat prolonged boredom and physical inactivity, he combined skills in black-and-white photography, visual design, and software coding to create an project.  
        After one year of regular social media posts, the project was put on hold due to the loss of electronic equipment following a theft. 
        In 2021, three years later, it was relaunched as a part-time artistic project, even though his legal status and human life as an immigrant remained uncertain, hopeless, angst-inducing and precarious.
