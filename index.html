      <h3>Introduction to the Photo Series</h3>
      <p>Welcome to <a href="https://awalkaday.art" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection"
          target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a>, a collection of 263 photographs created by Chris-Armel (<a href="https://daqhris.com/" target="_blank">daqhris</a>) and published on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> blockchain since February 2023. 

          This ongoing body of work captures the enchanting beauty seen in diverse landscapes of various Belgian regions through a captivating series of monochrome photographs. 

          Each photograph is assigned a unique identification token on the blockchain, guaranteeing its authenticity, verifiability, and accessibility to collectors with a digital wallet.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Pixels: A Stroll into Nature's Canvas</h3>

      <p>Embark on a visual journey with awalkaday.art, where the mission transcends pixels to ignite a passion for the great outdoors. 
        More than just a visual spectacle, this collection is a call to embrace the rejuvenating power of nature, urging everyone to get outside, 
        enjoy the fresh air, be captivated by the surroundings and cultivate well-being through the simplicity of regular walks, whether short or long.</p>

      <p>In an age of rapid urbanisation, many people feel disconnected from their local environment and lack the inspiration to explore unfamiliar landscapes. 
        The art of walking, one of the least tiring yet most rewarding physical activities, remains overlooked by most.</p>

      <p>Through the lens of Chris-Armel, awalkaday.art  is more than just a digital gallery; it is a testament to his passion for photography and a vessel for sharing his creative skills across borders and oceans.  
        The web gallery and Ethereum smart contract are seamlessly aligned in visual identity, ensuring effortless navigation for all who wish to discover and engage with this travelogue.</p>

      <h3>Chronicles of Creation: Navigating the Milestones</h3>

      <p>Let's dive into the key moments that have shaped his artistic journey — an odyssey navigated in solitude that has given birth to awalkaday.art. 
        Each milestone not only marks a significant achievement, but also adds another chapter to the evolving story of this distinctive endeavor.  
        Join us as we explore the turning points, triumphs and transformative experiences that have shaped the nature of awalkaday.art.</p>

      <h4>Creative, innovative, and ongoing walkways</h4>
      <p>The photo collection has evolved since its inception. Over the years, the artist has:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>captured and shared a series of monochrome photographs, depicting the beauty of different places in Belgium.</li>
        <li>cultivated a dedicated following on social media platforms, with hundreds of friends, followers and fans from all over the world.</li>
        <li>built an open source online gallery to provide a digital venue to showcase these photographs.</li>
        <li>created an immersive exhibition space in a 3D virtual environment that is open to the public at all times.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Internet footprints</h4>

      <p>The artistic journey began in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/" target="_blank">July 2017</a>, when the first photograph was posted on Instagram.

          Years later, in <a
          href="https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art" target="_blank">May 2021</a>, the Internet domain <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> was officially registered.

        An X (formerly Twitter) account, <a href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a>, was launched in November 2021 to share updates with a live and international audience. </p> 

        <p>A meaningful milestone was reached when selected photographs graced the virtual walls of the <a href="https://monolith.gallery/archives"
          target="_blank">MONOLITH Gallery</a> at Sellen Hall in <a
          href="https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG" target="_blank">July 2022</a>.
        
          Since <a href="https://x.com/awalkadayart/status/1703776310252736941?s=20" target="_blank">September 2023</a>, the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank">smart contract</a> and the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" target="_blank">contract deployer</a> are labeled by <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank">Etherscan</a>.  
          A congratulatory message citing the virtual exhibition hall was posted by <a href="https://art.art/" title=".ART domains - digital identity for your creative personality" target="_blank">.ART domains</a> on two social media platforms in <a href="https://x.com/Art_Domains/status/1755917791658418315?s=20" target="_blank">February 2024</a>.</p>

      <h4>Blockchain records</h4>

      <p>The blockchain publication of the collection was achieved with the creation of an eponymous <a
          href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/" target="_blank">smart contract</a> in <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cce44b92db9e6eb887fcbe90d59f5951e9928dea4540afbfe9fd3c2e9662f1f"
          target="_blank">August 2022</a>.

          This was followed by the registration of <a
          href="https://app.ens.domains/awalkaday.art" target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a> as an Ethereum domain in 
          <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353f1900e073e6d97f8230021c3fce153b4b930269e5c8bd4f47c9c3950b9337" target="_blank">September 2022</a>.

          About half a year later, the first batch of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1"
          target="_blank">WALK tokens</a> were minted on Ethereum by <a
          href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82"
          title="Artist's Ethereum wallet address" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a> in <a
          href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b"
          target="_blank">February 2023</a>, marking a significant moment in the on-chain history of awalkaday.art.
      </p>

      <p>In the virtual realm of blockchain-based digital art platforms, the artist has created a profile on behalf of his work and listed artworks on <a href="https://nft.coinbase.com/collection/awalkaday-art" target="_blank">Coinbase NFT</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/collection/awalkaday-art" target="_blank">Foundation</a>, <a href="https://rc.xyz/daqhris/collections/awalkaday.art" target="_blank">Rightclick</a>, <a href="https://thehug.xyz/artists/daqhris/portfolio/gallery/86a4f0a8-5609-4885-a9e2-ca0b625082e9" target="_blank">The Hug</a> and <a href="https://zora.co/collect/eth:0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1">Zora</a> in the second half of 2023. 
        As an independent creative coder, he plans to participate in the upcoming Ethereum-focused developer event, <a href="https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels" target="_blank">ETHGlobal Brussels</a>, during July 2024.</p>

      <h4>Mobile digital studio</h4>

      <h5>On-the-go digital photography</h5>

      <p>The collection focuses on Belgian locations and features a variety of subjects including landscapes, architecture and wildlife. 
        The photographs were taken at any time of day or night, while walking or strolling through the streets and alleyways of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels (Belgium) in the span of almost five years.</p>

      <p>Travel on foot became essential after the outbreak of a global pandemic in 2020, prompting the artist to resume his recreational pursuit and turn it into a therapeutic and mobile project.
        Such a minimalist technical setup reduces the fear of material loss and the pain of being deprived of physical possessions due to frequent moves in his adopted country.</p>

      <h5>Smartphone camera and photo editing</h5>

      <p>The photos were shot and edited using software applications, such as Snapseed, White Border and Scrambled Exif, installed on a <a
          href="https://www.android.com/one/" title="Android One: Secure, up-to-date and easy-to-use Android devices"
          target="_blank">Nokia smartphone</strong></a>.
        The low-cost phone had two rear cameras, including a 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, which can produce decent detail in well-lit conditions. 
        Overall, the camera had basic features to balance highlights and shadows in photos and help with scene recognition and optimisation, but these were limited by the mediocre sensors.</p> 

      <p>The smartphone was purchased in early 2021, without access to a stable and regular income, to meet the need for a dedicated mobile camera that regularly receives Android security updates from Google.  
        Previously, between 2017 and 2018, a smartphone manufactured by Xiaomi and purchased in Beijing (circa 2015) was used to record and edit still images.</p>

      <h5>Gaming laptop as an online building tool</h5>

      <p>For more robust tasks, a laptop computer, acquired on the Asian continent and branded as Hasee God of War, was of great use for coding sessions and web development phases. 
        This device was one of the few items that Chris smuggled out after a period of arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities in June 2016, and kept close to his heart as he made his way to a safer territory. 
        Surprisingly, like in a nightmare, it mysteriously crashed during a malware analysis in the winter of 2022. 
        Still alive and undiagnosed in his care, the nearly decade-old gaming laptop regained basic functionality under Linux software. </p>

      <h3>Digital Chronology: Harnessing Online Platforms</h3>

      <h4>Platforms as time-stamped publishing tools</h4>

      <h5>X</h5>

      <p><a href="https://x.com" target="_blank">X (Twitter)</a> facilitates real-time communication and micro-blogging, allowing users to share short-form media works and engage in public conversations. 
        Real-time news and updates about the collection are shared on X, where the artist posting via <a
          href="https://twitter.com/awalkadayart" target="_blank">@awalkadayart</a> connects with a diverse audience and builds relationships with fellow artists and collectors.</p>

      <h5>Instagram</h5>

      <p><a href="https://instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> emphasizes visual storytelling through photos and videos, enabling users to showcase their creativity and connect through imagery. 
        The monochrome photographs were originally posted on Instagram by <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/walk.day/" target="_blank">@walk.day</a> (managed by <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/iamdaqhris/" target="_blank">@iamdaqhris</a>), on an almost daily basis, continuously for years, with the geolocation and timestamp of the shot attached.</p> 
        
      <h5>Web gallery</h5>  
      <p>The photos were then uploaded to a purpose-built web gallery, <a href="https://awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="awalkaday.art Photography Collection"
          target="_blank">awalkaday.art</a>, which showcases 263 photographs from the collection in a custom-designed, interactive and immersive venue. It prioritises a smooth and random display of photographs, allowing for easy navigation and discovery of photographs. 
          An impressive exhibition space has also been set up to welcome all virtual visitors to <a href="https://oncyber.io/awalkaday.art" target="_blank" title="3D Exhibition Hall for awalkaday.art Photo Collection"
          target="_blank">oncyber.io/awalkaday.art</a>.</p>
          
      <h5>Ethereum</h5>

      <p><a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> is a decentralised blockchain platform that allows developers to create and deploy self-executing code in the form of smart contracts and applications. 
        Eventually, the visual artworks were minted as non-fungible <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/" title="ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard" target="_blank">ERC-721 tokens</a> on the Ethereum blockchain by <a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82" target="_blank"></a>0xb5ee030c71e76C3E03B2A8d425dBb9B395037C82 (<a href="https://app.ens.domains/daqhris.eth" target="_blank">daqhris.eth</a>).
        The artworks have been self-published and wrapped in the awalkaday.art smart contract on the public blockchain, where they can be verified, collected and exchanged.
        The contract address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1" target="_blank"><code>0xE31801C2E58b151C3deD2cB29dA56147b7f27eB1</code></a>.</p>

      <h4>Git commits as artist proofs</h4>

      <h5>GitHub</h5>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is renowned for its collaborative environment for software development, offering version control and project management tools for programmers. 
        The underlying source code for awalkaday.art Photo Collection is hosted on GitHub, where all changes can be tracked and audited.
        The public code repositories, available in Git format, contain all commits and code changes from day one of the project at <a href="https://github.com/awalkaday" title="GitHub public code repository" target="_blank">github.com/awalkaday</a>.</p>

      <h5>Open Source Software</h5>

      <p>To gain exposure to software-driven innovation, Chris-Armel (daqhris) has been an active contributor to the annual <a href="https://fosdem.org" title="FOSDEM Conference" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software Developer Conference</a> in Brussels every year since 2020. 
        It helps him stay in touch with the European software developers community, regardless of being a college dropout and not having the right to attend university or work professionally in the field. </p>

      <p>One of his memorable act as a volunteer was standing on stage to herald a talk about <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/nasa/" title="NASA and Open Source Software, by Steve Crawford"
        target="_blank">"Open Source Software at NASA"</a> in front of a packed amphitheater in February 2023. 
        In the coming days, he plans to use key features of the technical documentation tool <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/" title="Public Documentation Software - GitBook.com" target="_blank">GitBook</a> to create a digital book highlighting several aspects of his Git-enabled artistic practice.</p>

      <h3>Artist Profile</h3>

      <p><a href="https://daqhris.com" target="_blank">Chris-Armel</a> is the photographer and software developer of the
        awalkaday.art photography collection. He is a Burundi-born visual artist who currently lives in Belgium.</p>

      <p>It was in the very early days of Instagram (circa 2013) that Chris began to learn photography as a self-taught
        artist. At the time, he was a computer science student in Beijing, China. His unique style combines both
        traditional photography techniques and digital editing tools. The result is captivating photographs that
        highlight the natural charm of the Belgian landscape.</p>

      <p>Through digital photography, Chris-Armel aims to raise awareness about living a healthy and active lifestyle.
        In addition, he creatively uses his photographic skills to document a journey of living in a country of refuge
        after being persecuted by the authorities of his native country and their Chinese counterparts.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2017, while living in a Red Cross camp for asylum seekers in Namur, Belgium, Chris found a way
        to combat prolonged boredom and physical inactivity through a burst of creativity aimed at combining his skills
        in monochrome photography, visual design, and software coding.</p>

      <p>However, after one year of regular social media posts, the project was paused due to the loss of electronic
        equipment. Three years afterward, in the year 2021, the 'awalkaday' project was relaunched and became a
        part-time creative endeavor. To learn more, you may view his full bio online at <a
