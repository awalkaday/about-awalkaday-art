# Blockchain Records

The blockchain publication of the photo collection was achieved with the creation of an eponymous [smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) in [August 2022](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cce44b92db9e6eb887fcbe90d59f5951e9928dea4540afbfe9fd3c2e9662f1f). This was followed by the registration of [awalkaday.art](https://app.ens.domains/awalkaday.art) as an Ethereum domain name in [September 2022](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353f1900e073e6d97f8230021c3fce153b4b930269e5c8bd4f47c9c3950b9337).&#x20;

About half a year later, 263 [WALK tokens](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1) were minted on Ethereum in [February 2023](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2d4e5a73fada3bb3e626bec4b2d24bbdabce66fad66b70fbe8e3e0e1e169537b), marking a significant moment in the on-chain history of _awalkaday.art._&#x20;

In the virtual realm of blockchain-based art platforms, the artist has created a profile on behalf of his work and listed artworks on [Coinbase](https://nft.coinbase.com/collection/awalkaday-art), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/collection/awalkaday-art), [Rightclick](https://rc.xyz/daqhris/collections/awalkaday.art), [The Hug](https://thehug.xyz/artists/daqhris/portfolio/gallery/86a4f0a8-5609-4885-a9e2-ca0b625082e9), [Zora](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1) and [SuperRare](https://superrare.com/daqhris?artwork=ONLY\_SERIES) in the second half of 2023.&#x20;

As an artist, coder and hacker with published work on a blockchain, he participated in a 36-hour international hackathon and gathering of Ethereum software developers organized by [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels) and held for the first time in Brussels (July 2024).

Since then, after honing his skills as an Ethereum app developer and overcoming the learning curve of a hackathon, his next blockchain-based artistic project has been launched: [ZinnekeRescueMission](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/zinnekerescuemission-9fwjf).
