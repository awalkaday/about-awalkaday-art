# Internet Footprints

The visual art practice, reinforced by web surfing, began in [July 2017](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/), when a photo was posted on Instagram with the following caption: _<mark style="color:blue;">Don't watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going.</mark>_

The Internet domain _awalkaday.art_ was officially registered in [May 2021](https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art).&#x20;

One year later, a meaningful milestone was reached when selected photographs graced the virtual walls of the [MONOLITH Gallery](https://monolith.gallery/archives) inside Sellen Hall in [July 2022](https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG).&#x20;

A congratulatory message citing the virtual exhibition hall was posted by the [.ART web domains registry](https://art.art/) on two social media networks in [February](https://x.com/Art\_Domains/status/1755917791658418315?s=20) [2024](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MjM4NDY5NjU2MjEwMzQz?story\_media\_id=3301932341141746093\_5749556061\&igsh=MXVzbXJ0cmo4ZTByMQ==).
