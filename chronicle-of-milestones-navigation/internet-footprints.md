# Internet Footprints

The visual art practice, reinforced by web surfing, began in [July 2017](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/), when a photo was posted on Instagram with the following caption: _<mark style="color:blue;">Don't watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going.</mark>_

The first photo posted on Instagram in 2017. Its original photo file, as well as many other photos shared on Instagram between July and November, have been lost and are not preserved on the Ethereum blockchain.

The first and last photographs, preserved in the blockchain-based collection, appeared online respectively in [November 2017](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbXjDXsH22K) and [September 2022](https://www.instagram.com/p/CidZs2BDRMz).

The oldest photo in the blockchain-minted series was posted on Instagram in Nov 2017. Its original version was lost, but a copy was recovered, named and minted on a blockchain in the first quarter of 2023. Same story for all tokenized photos of the first two years.

The Internet domain `awalkaday.art` was officially registered in [May 2021](https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art).

One year later, a meaningful milestone was reached when selected photographs graced the virtual walls of the [MONOLITH Gallery](https://monolith.gallery/archives) inside Sellen Hall in [July 2022](https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG).

Since [September 2023](https://x.com/awalkadayart/status/1703776310252736941?s=20), the [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1) and the [contract deployer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82) are labeled by [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

A congratulatory message citing the virtual exhibition hall was posted by the [.ART web domains registry](https://art.art/) on two social media networks in [February](https://x.com/Art\_Domains/status/1755917791658418315?s=20) [2024](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MjM4NDY5NjU2MjEwMzQz?story\_media\_id=3301932341141746093\_5749556061\&igsh=MXVzbXJ0cmo4ZTByMQ==).
