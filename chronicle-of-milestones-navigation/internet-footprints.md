# Internet Footprints

The visual art practice, reinforced by web surfing, began in [July 2017](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvILEmAPcy/), when a photo was posted on Instagram with the following caption:

> Don't watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going.

The first and last photographs, preserved in the collection, appeared online respectively in [November 2017](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbXjDXsH22K) and [September 2022](https://www.instagram.com/p/CidZs2BDRMz).

The Internet domain _awalkaday.art_ was officially registered in [May 2021](https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=awalkaday.art). One year later, a meaningful milestone was reached when selected photographs graced the virtual walls of the [MONOLITH Gallery](https://monolith.gallery/archives) inside Sellen Hall in [July 2022](https://monolith.gallery/hall/sellen/g56L1RdA9DXtqQR3aALG).&#x20;

Since [September 2023](https://x.com/awalkadayart/status/1703776310252736941?s=20), the [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe31801c2e58b151c3ded2cb29da56147b7f27eb1) and the [contract deployer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5ee030c71e76c3e03b2a8d425dbb9b395037c82) are labeled by [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). A congratulatory message citing the virtual exhibition hall was posted by the [.ART web domains registry](https://art.art/) on two social media networks in [February](https://x.com/Art\_Domains/status/1755917791658418315?s=20) [2024](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MjM4NDY5NjU2MjEwMzQz?story\_media\_id=3301932341141746093\_5749556061\&igsh=MXVzbXJ0cmo4ZTByMQ==).
